widget_autoassign

When you access a task from a direct link, BonitaPortal display the form and you can work with him.
But when you want to submit the form, you got a "your are not assigned to the task".
This is particulary ennoy if you want to send the task list by email.

So, put this widget in the form, and branch the taskId and the UserId. The widget will do the job for you.
